### Hi there, My name is Jordan Thomas!


### Background
I graduated from a 4 year university with a B.A. in Economics and Psychology. After graduation I've had various jobs (a few in the Econ field) but I never really found much joy, excitement or room for growth in anything I was doing. So one day I stumbled upon coding (can't remember why or how haha) and I immediately fell in love with it. I loved the feeling of using your brain to create new projects and websites and the proud feeling of seeing your hardwork pay off once a project had been completed. So a few 1000 Youtube tutorials and a summer semester at coding bootcamp later.....here I stand! Ready and determined to become a great front end web developer!
